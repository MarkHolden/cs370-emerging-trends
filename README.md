## Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?
Most of the code in this project was provided, and only code that I "wrote" was already given in pseudocode.

## Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
### What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?
Computer scientist covers a very broad range of occupations. Some occupations held by computer scientists may be theoretical research on computer hardware or software, or they may be cryptographers who work to develop or crack the latest encryption schemes. It may refer to software engineers, who basically run the entire world. Software Engineering matters because pretty much everything runs on software at some level, and software engineers are the ones that make the software.

### How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?
I endeavor to approach every problem by following the Elon Musk Five Step Engineering Process:
1. Make your requirements less dumb (Requirements must come with a name, not a department).
2. Try hard to delete the part or process (If you aren't adding back 10% of the time, you aren't deleting enough).
3. Simplify or optimize (Most common error of a smart engineer is to optimize a thing that should not exist).
4. Accelerate cycle time (Not until after you have done all the others - if you are digging your grave, don't dig it faster, stop digging!).
5. Automate.  
(Dodd & Musk, 2021)

### What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?
My ethical responsibilities in the development of software is to accurately judge the consequences of the software that I write, and ensure that it does not harm the end user, the organization for which I work, myself, or any other person.

Beyond the obvious responsibility to not do harm to others, I am also ethically bound to do the most good that I can. There are a few ways to accomplish this. First, I will follow Uncle Bob's advice in his book "The Clean Coder" to do everything in my power to make it so QA finds no defects in my code (Martin, 2011). Second, I must continually grow my skill-set to provide ever more value to my employer.

Finally, this may not be an ethical responsibility, but it is within my power to control, so I act as if it is, I must put forth every effort to support and accelerate the human colonization of Mars. To do that, I must make myself more appealing to the resume filters and hiring managers at SpaceX by getting a CS degree, building my experience at work, and learning on my own.
